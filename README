Sample AUI Validator Taglib Portlet

Compatible with Liferay 6.1.1 GA2.  Not tested with other versions.

Author: Drew A. Blessing
Date: August 21, 2012

This portlet was written to give a working example of how the Alloy UI validator taglib works.  It was created in conjunction with blog post http://theblessinglife.com/technical-blog/-/blogs/alloy-form-validator-taglib.

This package contains both the source code and a deployable WAR file. To deploy a working example simply drop the .war file in your Liferay hot deploy directory.

NOTE: I am providing this portlet in hopes of helping others. I do not mind if you copy, post, share this package as long as proper credit is given. If you find this helpful, please pass it along.
